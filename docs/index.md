## Why LSM Trees?

LSM trees power some of the world's most important databases. They're the secret behind:

- **Google's LevelDB** and Bigtable
- **Meta's RocksDB** (used in MySQL, MongoDB, and more)
- **Apache Cassandra** and HBase
- **CockroachDB** and many others

Unlike traditional B-trees, LSM trees optimize for **write performance** by deferring the cost of maintaining sorted data:

```
Write Path:  Memory ‚Üí Sequential Log ‚Üí Background Merge
             ‚Üì         ‚Üì                ‚Üì
             Fast!     Fast!            Amortized
```

## What You'll Build

Over 6 phases, you'll implement:

1. **MemTable & WAL** - In-memory buffer with crash recovery
2. **SSTables** - Sorted on-disk storage with efficient reads
3. **Deletions** - Tombstones and removal logic
4. **Compaction** - Background merging to reclaim space
5. **Bloom Filters** - Skip unnecessary disk reads
6. **Optimizations** - Caching, multi-level compaction, and more

## Learning Approach

This isn't just code - it's a **learning journey** where you'll:

- Read foundational papers (O'Neil et al. 1996)
- Study production implementations (LevelDB)
- Understand trade-offs (write vs read vs space amplification)
- Benchmark and profile your implementation
- Document your insights for others
